Dataset description:

In this homework, we did the training of a simple network to classify the weather conditions while driving. 
Berkeley DeepDrive dataset: https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/
contains a large amount of annotated driving data such as 2D bounding boxes, image segmentation, drivable areas and so on. You can read more about the dataset here,
